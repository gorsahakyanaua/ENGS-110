Here are the notes from the second lecture on 08/28/23 
 In this lecture, we discussed the Unix system, git and other commands, and the structure of the user interface /kernel/system interface. 
 Although the commands were complicated and unclear, after vim,git and gcc everything became a bit clearer and with practice I got used to using Linux and navigating the terminal smoothly.
